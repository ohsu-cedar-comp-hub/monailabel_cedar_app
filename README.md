# CEDAR-NVIDIA-Pilot
A (pilot) repository for collaborative code-sharing between Cancer Early Detection Advanced Research (CEDAR) Center at OHSU Knight Cancer Institute and NVIDIA, focused on prostate biopsy image analysis and tumor digital twins.

The original repository is https://github.com/ohsu-cedar-comp-hub/CEDAR-NVIDIA-Pilot/tree/monai_label_app. The code is merged into this project for easy managment. 

The code in this folder needs to be installed according to README.md in the parent folder.
